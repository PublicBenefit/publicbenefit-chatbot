# PublicBenefit ChatBot Control Suite

## Start ChatBot
- Double-click "Start ChatBot" shortcut.
- This will launch Flask server minimized and open your browser to http://192.168.1.214:5000/
- The server auto-restarts if it crashes.

## Stop ChatBot
- Double-click "Stop ChatBot" shortcut.
- This will kill all running python.exe processes and cleanly stop the server.

## Notes
- Both shortcuts can have custom icons assigned (Rocket for Start, Stop Sign for Stop).
- Keep the .bat files inside your project folder.
- Only the shortcuts should live on your Desktop.

Enjoy building! ðŸš€
